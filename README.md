# QAP

In this repository there are codes connected to my Master's Thesis. 
I studied the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) and I implemented heuristic and metaheuristic algorithm to find numerical "good" solutions.

The files are:

* QAP: The main program. 
* Greedy1: this is an implementation of Greedy1 algorithm;
* Greedy2: this is an implementation of Greedy2 algorithm;
* Greedy3: this is an implementation of Greedy3 algorithm;
